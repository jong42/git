Code from the first excercise.
If you want to try it out, please note:

1. tutorial.m is NOT a valid M file (I think).
   I rather used it to copy&paste one line at a time.

2. The M files (foo.m, mysmooth.m) have to be in Matlab's "Current Directory"
   in order for Matlab to find the functions foo() and mysmooth().

Have fun.
